The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [May 17, Friday, 2019].

### Day 1: May 17, 2019
##### Writing React Component and CSS

**Today's Progress**: Setup Storybook-React, write FlipCounter React CSS

**Thoughts:** I am not very good at CSS, especially animated CSS which is really painful to me. I started by learning concept of animation by Flip Counter which replace old frame with flip effect and draw new frame. I still not very satisfied with today progress but feel good start learning.
