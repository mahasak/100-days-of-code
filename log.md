# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Mahasak Pijittum

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [June 23, Friday, 2019].

### Day 1: June 23, 2019
##### Start project BearBot

**Today's Progress**: Start setting up a project using Firebase Cloud function - TypeScript to serve my personal bot using for collecting my curated list and update to github. Today i rebuild a project cli and setup TypeScript with Webpack and setup custom domain. 

**Thoughts:** I'm thinking about next step to build CI for this project to ensure my workflow is correctly setup.

### Day 2: June 24, 2019
##### Setup CI/CD

**Today's Progress**: Today i learn setting up CP/CD for my project on CircleCI, i need to setup webpack from scratch to support typescript instead of using builtin tsc which came with firebase-cli.
